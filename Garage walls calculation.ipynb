    "# What sort of garage heater should my dad buy?\n",
    "\n",
    "My dad makes furniture in a shop that's unattached from his house.  For years, he's heated the shop with scrap wood in a wood stove.  Recently, his home insurance premium has risen to \\$2500/year.  He can switch home insurance companies and have a \\$500 annual premium, but, he'll have to remove the wood stove and replace it with one or more electric heaters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shop is in central Minnesota. He uses the stove from November through March. Electricity costs \\$0.10/kWh.  The shop is 32' by 24', 9' high.  The walls are insulated with 6\" fiberglass batts.  There is one 32\"x80\" door, 6 2'x3' windows, and a double garage door in the first floor.  The garage door is insulated with 2\" of foam.  The windows are approximately R-3.  Relevant climate information lives here: https://weatherspark.com/y/10478/Average-Weather-in-Monticello-Minnesota-United-States-Year-Round\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions:\n",
    "1. How much power does the shop lose through the walls on a 15F day, if the shop is held at an inside temperature of 60F?\n",
    "2. If paint freezes, it is spoiled for later use.  If my dad leaves on a trip for a week and it gets down to -20F at night, what heater power is necessary to hold the inside temperature at 45F?\n",
    "3. Which heater should my dad buy?  He likes shopping at Menards, https://www.menards.com/main/heating-cooling/heaters/electric-garage-heaters/c-6328.htm\n",
    "4. If the average inside temperature is 60F and the average outside temperature (over the whole heating season, 5 months) is 20F, how much will my dad pay for electricity?  If he switches insurance companies will he save money?"
